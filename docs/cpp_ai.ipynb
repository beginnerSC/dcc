    "# Vector::iterator - begin/end correctness\n",

    "## The Problem with nullptr and Pointer Arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue**: In a default-constructed `Vector`, `a_` is `nullptr` and `size_` is `0`. Computing `end()` as `a_ + size_` performs pointer arithmetic on a null pointer, which is undefined behavior—even when `size_ == 0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it's UB**: The C++ standard doesn't allow pointer arithmetic on null pointers. Even `nullptr + 0` is undefined behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional issue**: The default constructor sets `capacity_ = 10` but doesn't allocate storage, so the first `push_back` will try to write to unallocated memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Two Clean Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Always Maintain a Valid Buffer (Eager Allocation)\n",
    "- Allocate storage in the default constructor with the initial `capacity_` (e.g., 10 elements).\n",
    "- Then `begin() = a_` and `end() = a_ + size_` are always safe.\n",
    "- **Pros**: Simplest mental model; mirrors `std::vector` implementations that keep non-null `data()` even when empty.\n",
    "- **Cons**: Uses a small amount of memory upfront (fine for practice).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2: Lazy Allocation with Guards\n",
    "- Keep `a_` as `nullptr` until first allocation, but:\n",
    "  - Set `capacity_ = 0` initially (not 10).\n",
    "  - In `end()`: if `a_` is `nullptr`, return `iterator(a_)` (same as `begin()`) without doing arithmetic.\n",
    "  - In `push_back()`: handle `capacity_ == 0` case by growing to at least 1 before writing.\n",
    "- **Pros**: No memory allocated until needed.\n",
    "- **Cons**: Must be careful with growth from capacity 0 and avoid any pointer arithmetic on nullptr.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Invariants to Maintain\n",
    "\n",
    "**Invariant A (eager)**: `a_` is never null after construction. Then `begin()/end()` can freely use `a_` and `a_ + size_`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Invariant B (lazy)**: `a_` can be null, but:\n",
    "- `begin()` returns `iterator(a_)`\n",
    "- `end()` returns `iterator(a_)` when `a_` is null (no arithmetic), otherwise `iterator(a_ + size_)`\n",
    "- `push_back()` must allocate when `capacity_ == 0` before writing\n",
    "- `capacity_` must accurately reflect real storage (0 when null, not 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sanity Checklist\n",
    "- ✓ Default ctor + `push_back(42)` works without crashing\n",
    "- ✓ `begin() == end()` on an empty vector, without any pointer arithmetic on nullptr\n",
    "- ✓ After first allocation, `end()` is exactly one past the last element (`a_ + size_`)\n",
    "- ✓ Optional: mark `begin()/end()` as `noexcept` once UB path is eliminated\n",

    "## Where to Use noexcept in Vector::iterator\n",
    "\n",
    "Mark functions `noexcept` when, under documented preconditions, they cannot throw exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Safe for noexcept (operations that don't throw):\n",
    "- `iterator(int*) noexcept` — just stores a pointer\n",
    "- `int& operator*() const noexcept` — dereferencing doesn't throw (UB if invalid, but not an exception)\n",
    "- `iterator& operator++() noexcept` — pointer increment is non-throwing\n",
    "- `iterator operator++(int) noexcept` — makes trivial copy and increments\n",
    "- `bool operator==(const iterator&) const noexcept` — pointer comparisons don't throw\n",
    "- `bool operator!=(const iterator&) const noexcept` — pointer comparisons don't throw\n",
    "- `int* GetPtr() const noexcept` — just returns the pointer\n",
    "- `iterator begin() noexcept` — constructs iterator from pointer (once UB is fixed)\n",
    "- `iterator end() noexcept` — constructs iterator from pointer (once UB is fixed)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- **Built-in ops don't throw**: pointer arithmetic, comparisons, trivial copies are all safe\n",
    "- **UB is not an exception**: dereferencing invalid pointers is UB, not an exception—noexcept only means \"won't throw\"\n",
    "- **Document preconditions**: e.g., \"iterator must be dereferenceable\" for `operator*`\n",
    "- **Watch for**: allocations, bounds checking, user code that might throw"
